The application is designed to help event organisers manage participants in an event. Participants sign up for an event,
are given an account with an associated QR code. This code is then used to sign into the event, and any of the activities at
the event. Participants may be unable to sign up for certain activities if they haven't completed "prerequisite" activities,
such as checking into into the event itself.

Due to course requirements, the project is built using C++. The front end gui of the application was built using Qt. The QR codes were
generated and scanned using the OpenCV library, and our database was built using SQLite.
